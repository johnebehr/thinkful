    "# 20.03 The ID3 Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "So far decision tree growing with an entropy criterion has been covered.  In doing so how that would actually work got skipped.  This notebook will give more detail into how an algorithm to do that will practically function.  This notebook will cover the ID3 algorithm, which is a popular algorithm for building decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ID3 Algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "ID3 stands for _Iterative Dichotomizer 3_, and is one of the simplest ways to create a decision tree.  It can be generalized into more robust scenarios, but the implementation is based on the framework covered here.  Essentially ID3 goes through every feature to find the most valuable attribute then then splits base on it.  It moves further and further down the tree until it either has a pure class or has met a terminating condition.  The details will be covered below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start working with ID3 there are some requirements for the data in its most basic form.  First, outcomes must be binary.  The simplest version of ID3 is a binary classifier.  The attributes you'll use to build the tree also have to be categorical.  Attributes can have many categories, but they must be known and countable.  If those two criteria are met, then you can build a basic ID3 classifying algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing you'll need for this is the definition of entropy from 20.02.  Shannon Entropy $H$, is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = -\\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i)log_2 P(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity of calculation, you can make the following transformation to the definition: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i)log_2 \\frac{1}{P(x_i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This removes the negative sign up front and will make it easier to implement the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating Entropy \n",
    "\n",
    "Since this algorithm is based on entropy, a quick example will be given on how to calculate it.  Say you have 20 students, and you're trying to classify them as male and female.  The only attribute you have is whether their height is tall, medium, or short.  Of the 20 students, 12 are boys and 8 are girls.  Of the 12 boys, 4 are tall, 6 are medium, and 2 are short.  For the 8 girls, 1 is tall, 2 are medium, and 5 are short.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are trying to find the entropy, both before and after any rule is applied for being tall.  The initial entropy is just the formula plugged in over both the possible classes of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = P(male)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(male)} + P(female)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(female)}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{12}{20}*log_2 \\frac{20}{12} + \\frac{8}{20}*log_2 \\frac{20}{8} = .971 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now apply the rule _height = short_.  You need to calculate the weighted average of the two entropies, one for the short students and one for the non-short students.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H(short) = P(male)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(male)} + P(female)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(female)}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{2}{7}*log_2 \\frac{7}{2} + \\frac{5}{7}*log_2 \\frac{7}{5} = .863 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H(not\\_short) = P(male)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(male)} + P(female)*log_2 \\frac{1}{P(female)}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{10}{13}*log_2 \\frac{13}{10} + \\frac{3}{13}*log_2 \\frac{13}{3} = .779 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all the probabilities are conditional on the criteria youâ€™re assuming (short or not short).  Now the weighted average of the two is just:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(short) * H(short) + P(not\\_short) * H(not\\_short) = \\frac{7}{20} * .863 + \\frac{13}{20} * .779 = .809 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The entropy from this question goes from 0.971 to 0.809.  That is an improvement.  Use the space below to calculated the entropy of the other criteria, calculate for students tall or medium:  \n"

Firstly, the solution is not necessarily optimal. The tree can get stuck in local optima, just like with the gradient descent algorithm. It also has no way to work backwards if it finds itself in an informationless space. You can add criteria to make it stop before the tree has grown to run out of attributes or all leaf nodes are single classes."
