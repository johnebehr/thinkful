Sampling bias is introduced because the sample groups are not representative of the typical customer.  Due to the groups being drawn from from a peek sales month and a low sale month Assignment to conditions bias comes into play.  This assumes that the designers of the test are not looking specifically for these customers for another purpose.  The test could be staged to use past emails, updated for the use case, in an attempt to control for the seasonal effects.</p>"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"<p style=font-size:1.25em;>2. <em>You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.</em></p>\n<p>The clinic is failing to consider <em>Assignment to conditions bias</em> since they specialized in anxiety treatment visitors will self-selct to visit the clinic thus reducing the randomness of clinic visitors.

The experiment assumes a much faster uptick in customer visits than is realisticly possible.  The experiment is assuming too short a timeframe causing an <em>Assignment to conditions bias</em> and an <em>Observer bias</em> where the observer has the expectation of an imediate return.
