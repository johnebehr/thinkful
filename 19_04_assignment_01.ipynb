    "Suppose that we would like to know how much families in the US are spending on recreation annually. We've estimated the following model:\n",

    "$$ expenditure = 873 + 0.0012annual\\_income + 0.00002(annual\\_income)^2 - 223.57have\\_kids $$\n",

    "*expenditure* is the annual spending on recreation in US dollars, *annual_income* is the annual income in US dollars, and *have_kids* is a dummy variable indicating the families with children. Interpret the estimated coefficients. What additional statistics should be given in order to make sure that your interpretations make sense statistically. Write up your answer."

    "In order to correctly interpret the estimated coefficients, I would need to see the t-test and p-values for each of the coefficents.  The t-test will determine if an individual coefficient is statistically different from zero.  The p-value quantifies when the coefficient is equal to zero in the real population.  Generally, a p-value $ \t\\leqslant 0.1 $ is statistically significant, more desirable is a p-value $ \t\\leqslant 0.05 $."
