I'd be hesitant to say how predictive the percentages are since I don't have any details on where the numbers came from.  What is the sample size? What is the Standard Error?  Is there any Bias built into these percentages?  If directed to come up with an answer based solely on the information presented I say that $ \\textit{21.5%} $ of Americans are fans of the Brady Bunch.
