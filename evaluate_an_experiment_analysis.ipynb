Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.</em></p>\n<p>I assume that the data scientists in charge of the experiment are aware of who Emperor Palpatine is and therefore I would argue that signifigant case can be made for <em>Observer bias</em>.  Additionally, droids are not suitable test subjects since they are incapable of moral constructs which is a pretty clear case of <em>Selection bias</em>.</p>"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"<p style=font-size:0.9em;>2. <em>In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.</em></p>\n<p>First the experiment suffers from <em>Sampling bias</em> because the two sample groups lack randomness.  The experiment is also flaweed when it comes to <em>Assignment to conditions bias</em> because all of sample one is friendly to the Jedi cause and all of sample is unfriendly to the Jedi cause.  <em>Context bias</em> is also involved from the standpoint that each planet is going to have a miriad of differences from the other planets which would be very difficult to control for.</p>\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"<p style=font-size:0.9em;>3. <em>A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology.
